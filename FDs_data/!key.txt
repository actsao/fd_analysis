Folder Endings:
"_Visual":  Contains images of residual graphs and histograms
"_ArtVein": Contains fractal dimension data separated by artery and vein

Folders:
- FDs:              FDs using powers of 2 as box sizes
- FDs_20Size:       FDs using [2, 20, 2] as box sizes
- FDs_20SizeBy1:    FDs using [2, 20, 1] as box sizes
- FDs_ManySize:     FDs using [2, max_size/2, 2] as box sizes
- FDs_ManySizeBy1:  FDs using [2, max_size/2, 1] as box sizes

Additional Notes:
- FDs, unless indicated, are calculated over the ENTIRE series of box sizes
- Square brackets indicate a series of numbers defined as [start, end, step_size]
- "max_size" indicates maximum box size allowed for image
  - this is usually the smallest image dimension
